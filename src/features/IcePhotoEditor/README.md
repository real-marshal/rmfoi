# IcePhotoEditor

This is a simple photo editor a la Lightroom. It doesn't make much sense as it only works with already compressed images instead of RAW files, but let's not get too crazy, ok?

Still very basic, done in about 2 weeks, needs some serious optimization work and more useful adjustments like curves, hue shifts etc, but I have more important work to do right now so calling it completed for now.
